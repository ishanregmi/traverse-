            <h3>What is Traverse?</h3>
            <p>A traverse is made up of several straight lines with defined lengths that are connected to one another by known angles. Traverse stations are the locations that designate the ends of the traverse lines. By measuring the distances between the traverse stations, which act as control points, and the angles subtended at each station by its neighboring stations, one can establish control points by traverse surveying.</p>

            <h3>Computation of  Closed Traverse</h3>
            <p>This site aims to calculate the coorindate of unknown staions from two known stations. After measuring the observerd angles and the distance of corresponding traverse leg we can calculate the unknown coordinates. Bowditch rule is used for adjustment of closed Traverse. However this doesnot include computation of Reduced Level of the respective stations.
                We can here compute the cooridinate using clockwise angle obeservatopn.
